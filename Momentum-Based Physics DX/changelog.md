## Momentum-Based Physics DX V1.4 - The Apotos Update!
- More customization options have beed added.
- Both drift versions have been adjusted a little.
- Sonic's air drag has been increased.
- Sonic looses more speed when stomping, so that landing on the right spot at high velocity is now more easy to achieve.
- Sonic now recovers faster after getting knocked down.
- Sonic's Homing Attack target range had to be toned down slightly because of some werid shenanigans.
- Sonic's starting speed when jumping on a rail is now a little lower.
- Sonic now looses a little bit more speed when turning while boosting.
- Sonic's max speed is now significantly lower. (I found out I accidentally made him even faster than what i had originaly intended lmao)
- Sonic's max speed when sky diving is now also momentum based. The longer You hold the X Button, the faster he gets. His max speed when sky diving is now 8x faster. His normal fallspeed when sky diving was unchanged. (If you stop diving when having high speed, he will sadly abruptly snap back to his normal speed.)
- I have made notes for every parameter i have changed in sonic's physics file. If you want to make any personal changes to the physics, feel free to edit them to you'r hearts content. Just don't reupload them under your name without crediting me.
- I started learning how to use SonicGLvl and made Unscripted versons of all day-time levels for Apotos!
It was difficult to learn how to use SonicGLvl and how I was gonna aproach this but after non-stop work and many try-and-errors, I finally have all day-time levels of Apotos unscripted so go nuts! (I actually worked almost every single day the whole day on this bc, let's just say, it wasn't as simple as someone would think.) I hope you enjoy this update and SHOW ME YOU'R MOVES! :D

## Momentum-Based Physics DX V1.3.1
- Fixed an issue with the mod.ini file because the Gaia Colossus's Speed Option wouldn't turn off, even if you disabled it.

## Momentum-Based Physics DX V1.3
- The FOV when boosting has been increased slightly.
- The camera in 2D is now a little further away.
- I added custom configuration options to the mod! You can now enable or disable any of my extra content i included and choose between 2 types of drifts i've provided.

## Momentum-Based Physics DX V1.2
- The Drift is now a little more responsive.
- Sonic now decelerates a little bit more when turning while moving.

## Momentum-Based Physics DX V1.1
- Added Auto Update Function.
- Adjusted the Drift a little.
- Removed infinite boost from my testing. Woopsy. ^^'

## Momentum-Based Physics DX V1.0
- First Release
