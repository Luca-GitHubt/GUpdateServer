Title="Momentum-Based Physics DX"
Description="A mod that makes the boost accell over time. Also adds many refined and new features to sonics gameplay overall. A "dinamic" drift that gives the player way more control of sonics speed, SA2/Heroes style grinding where you have to keep sonic balance and way more momentum when gaining speed and jumping off of slopes. Sonics max speed is also his true speed now! Exactly 767 mph! ...At least it was considered at one point."
